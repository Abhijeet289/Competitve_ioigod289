Given : An undirected graph and also promised that each node can be visited from every other node.
Task : You need to direct the edges such that whole graph is a SCC
Solution :
	Simply run a dfs, and direct the edges in the dfs manner.
	Now you get a directed graph.
	Check the number of SCC's using Kosaraju's algorithm.
	If the number of SCC's = 1 then we get the answer or the answer does not exist.
